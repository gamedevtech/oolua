- Refactored Lua_table removing the lua_State instead using the reference's state member
- Added a default implementation of Proxy_class which creates a typedef that identifies it as a none proxy type

- Visual Studio work around for when taking the address of a function
- Added quotation marks to TargetPath as a post build event in visual studio. Directories with a space caused a problem.

- Exceptions now can pop the error of the Lua stack and Runtime_error can be initialsed with a string
- oolua_member_function.h 's proxy calling functions now wrap code in a try block if exceptions are enabled.
