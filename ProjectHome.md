# What is OOLua #
OOLua is a C++ binding for [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) which is intended to ease the embedding of Lua in C++ allowing easy access to tables, functions to be called and types to be pushed and pulled from the stack; also C++ in Lua by binding functions, types and class hierarchies. It is compatible with Lua 5.1.`*`, 5.2.`*`, LuaJIT-1.1.8 and LuaJIT2.
<br />
This is not a fully original work, instead it builds on ideas from binding classes using [Luna](http://lua-users.org/wiki/CppBindingWithLunar) and [Lua Technical Note 5](http://www.lua.org/notes/ltn005.html). OOLua uses a [domain specific language](DSL.md) set of macros which internally use templates and generate non intrusive proxies for types.

# Why you should try it #
  * [fast](Speed_comparisons.md)
  * easy to use
  * cross platform
  * free (MIT)
  * no dependencies
  * non intrusive
  * does not use exceptions by default ([can be configured to use exceptions](Building#Config.md))
  * does not use C++ [RTTI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information)
  * [test driven](UnitTests.md)

# Dependencies #
The library has no external dependencies yet relies heavily on Loki type lists, which the design and implementation of which is described in [Andrei Alexandrescuâ€™s excellent book](http://erdani.com/index.php/books/modern-c-design/). A rewritten version of the type list templates are included in this library ([Loki is released under MIT](http://loki-lib.sourceforge.net/index.php?n=Main.License) ) which were written as an aid to my learning when I first read the book.
